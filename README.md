#### Install Node.js

1. Check if you already have Node.js installed. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If node is not installed on your machine, you can go to the official nodejs.org website, and choose the version depending on your operating system:

- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Install Node.js and npm on Windows, Linux or Mac OSX</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm" target="_blank">Or, install Node Version Manager to quickly install and use different versions of Node.js</a>

2. Enable pnpm with corepack

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

> _corepack is installed with node from **v16.13.x**, if your version is below, install it with: `npm install -g corepack`_

To setup the template and start installing project dependencies, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

> **Note:** This will install depenencies form all packages that matches with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. If you need to clear all `node_modules`, you can use `pnpm clear:all` command.
